# ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA)

ANOVAs use information about variances, but the main goal of analysis is comparison of MEANS (don’t let the name mix you up - more on this later).


**ANOVA is an omnibus test** – it tests for significant differences between any means in the study

**ANOVA is just a special case of the linear model**

---

## ANOVA Hypotheses:

**Null Hypothesis (H0):** All means are equal (in other words, all groups are from populations with the same mean)

**Alternative Hypothesis (HA):** At least two group means are NOT equal (that means that just two could be different, or they could ALL be different)


---

## One-way ANOVA (single factor)

What does this one-way/single-factor refer to? 

There is a **single factor** (*variable*), with at least 3 **levels**, where we are trying to compare means across the different levels of that factor.
