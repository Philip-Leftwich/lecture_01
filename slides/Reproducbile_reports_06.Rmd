| Mean        | Median      | Mode       |
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| The average value     | The middle value      |The most frequent value      |
| Sum of the total divided by *n*   | The middle value (if *n* is odd). The average of the two central values (if *n* is even)      |The most frequent value      |
| Most common reported measure, affected by outliers | Less influenced by outliers, improves as *n* increases | Less common

## Calls for reproducibility

**Reproducibility** has the potential to serve as a minimum standard for judging scientific claims when full independent replication of a study is not possible.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.alt = "Reproducible Research in Computational Science ROGER D. PENG, SCIENCE 02 DEC 2011 : 1226-1227"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/repro-spectrum.jpg")
```

## Literate programming

Treat program as literature to be understandable to human beings

Literate programming is an approach to programming in which the code is explained using natural language alongside the source code

---
## Literate programming in R

Rmarkdown (`.Rmd`) integrates:

* a documentantion language (`.md`)

* a programming language (`R`)

* functionality to "knit" them together through ðŸ“¦ `knitr`

### Features

âœ… provides a framework for writing narratives around code and data

âœ… Code re-run in a clean environment every time the document is "knit"

Enables a two-way R Markdown-Microsoft Word workflow. It generates Word documents that can be de-rendered back into R Markdown, retaining edits on the Word document, including tracked changes.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.cap = "Rmarkdown to word"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/redoc.png")
