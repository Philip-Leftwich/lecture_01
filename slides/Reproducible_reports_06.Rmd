## Calls for reproducibility

**Reproducibility** has the potential to serve as a minimum standard for judging scientific claims when full independent replication of a study is not possible.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.alt = "Reproducible Research in Computational Science ROGER D. PENG, SCIENCE 02 DEC 2011 : 1226-1227"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/repro-spectrum.jpg")

## Literate programming

Treat program as literature to be understandable to human beings

Literate programming is an approach to programming in which the code is explained using natural language alongside the source code

---
## Literate programming in R

Rmarkdown (`.Rmd`) integrates:

* a documentantion language (`.md`)

* a programming language (`R`)

* functionality to "knit" them together through üì¶ `knitr`

### Features

‚úÖ provides a framework for writing narratives around code and data

‚úÖ Code re-run in a clean environment every time the document is "knit"

## Rmarkdown to pdf

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.cap = "Rmarkdown template left, output on the right"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pdf.png")

## Rmarkdown to pdf

* Rmarkdown documents can be compiled to PDF, which is a great feature. 

* In order to convert the documents to PDF, they use a software called LaTeX (pronounced *la-tek* or *lay-tek*).

* Installing LaTeX can be a pain, but thankfully there is an easier way to install it - `tinytex`. 

* `tinytex` is an R package that installs a sane, lightweight (<200Mb) version of LaTeX.

* RStudio Cloud has `tinytex` pre-installed.

## Applications

Rmd documents can be useful for a number of research related long form documentation materials:

* Electronic notebooks

* Supplementary Materials

* Reports

* Papers

* Presentations


---
##YAML

```
---
title: "An example document"
author: "Philip Leftwich"

## Rcode

* Code chunks are marked by three backticks and curly braces with r (and an optional chunk name) inside them: 

.pull-left[


````r
`r ''````{r chunk-name}
# computer code goes in three back ticks
1 + 1
2 + 2

```
````


]

.pull-right[

```{r, echo = FALSE}

##Rmarkdown to Word

üì¶ `redoc`

Enables a two-way R Markdown-Microsoft Word workflow. It generates Word documents that can be de-rendered back into R Markdown, retaining edits on the Word document, including tracked changes.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.cap = "Rmarkdown to word"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/redoc.png")
```

## Publish to the web


* RPubs: Publish rendered Rmarkdown documents on the web with the click of a button http://rpubs.com/

* GitHub: Host your site through gh-pages on GitHub. Enable in GitHub repo ‚öôÔ∏èSettings


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.cap = "Github pages"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/gh-pages.png")
```

## Data analysis notebooks

* Simple templates for hosting your [literate programming analysis online](https://github.com/lmullen/rmd-notebook)

* Rnotebook files run in the same way as an Rmd file

* Has 'preview' button not 'knit'

* Produces an html "snapshot" of the file everytime it is saved

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.alt = "R notebooks snapshot"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/notebook.png")
```
