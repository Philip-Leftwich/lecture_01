## Sampling distribution * Standard Error

If we had a bunch of samples, and found their *probability distribution*(e.g. gaussian, mean and sd etc), then we would be able to predict the **sampling distribution**

```{r, eval = F}
# function to generate samples with a normal distribution
rnorm(n = 100, mean = 10, sd  = 1)

```

--

The **standard deviation of the sampling distribution of means** is the **standard error**. It is calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the square root of the sample size:

$$
SE = {\sigma\over\sqrt n}
$$

---

## Standard Error

How much does your **sample statistic** differ from the population parameter *aka* how accurate is your mean?

**Q. What happens to SE as sample size increases?**



$$
SE = {\sigma\over\sqrt n}
$$

---

### Descriptive statistics

If we want to say how widely scattered our measurements are we use the **standard deviation**.

--

### Inferential statistics

If we want to indicate some level of uncertainty around our estimate of the mean, we use the **standard error**. 

We can also use standard error to calculate a **confidence interval**

---

## Central Limit Theorem

Most analyses require some sort of assumptions of a normal distribution. 

**Central limit theorem** states that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of means follows a normal distribution, *regardless of the underlying shape of a population*. 

In order for this to hold true the **sample size** (*n*) must be sufficiently larger

---

## Large enough sample size

**Q. What is a large enough sample size?**

--

You will often hear *n* $\geq$ *30* as large enough to claim means are normally distributed according to CLT

--

This depends on how far removed the underlying shape of a population *is* from a normal distribution

* If the population distribution is symmetrical, it could be as small as 15.

* If the population is sufficiently skewed it could be as high as 100. 

--

Also see **bootstrapping**

class: middle

## Statistical inference

We want to *understand* something about our populations using observations from a random sample

--

We only have a *sample*, therefore there will always be uncertainty about the population.

--

How do we express this?

---
class: center, middle, inverse

## Confidence Intervals

---

## Common misconception

"There is a 95% chance that the **true** population mean is within this range"

--

The mean either *is* or *is not* within this range

--

"If we repeat this experiment many times, 95% of our computed confidence intervals would contain the *true mean*"

Frame the probability around the intervals not the population parameter.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.alt = " Confidence Intervals"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/CI-experiments.png")
```

---

## Confidence levels

Can be constructed by YOU:

Do you want to know the range within which you will capture the mean...

* 90% of the time

--

* 95%

--

* 99%

--

The Confidence level (C) is the inverse of the significance level.

$$
\huge\alpha = 1 - C
$$
---

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.alt = " Confidence Intervals"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/confidence-interval-area.png")
```

---

## Calculating a Confidence interval

This requires us to **know** the population variance (standard deviation)


$$
\bigg[\overline x - z_{a\over2} * {\sigma\over {\sqrt n}}
$$


$$
\overline x + z_{a\over2} *{\sigma\over {\sqrt n}}\bigg]
$$

--


**Q. How likely is this?**


---

## Z distribution

So far we have used the z-distribution. This is OK for normally distributed data, where we have population $\mu$ and $\sigma$. 

When we don't know the population mean and SD

--

Then we cannot be sure of our uncertainty

--

Three choices: 

1. Assume we have a big enough sample size and CLT fixes this

2. Use another type of sampling distribution (e.g. t-distribution)

3. Bootstrap our sampling distribution

---

## Bootstrapping

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="120%", fig.alt = "With as few as 10 data points in our random sample, it is possible to do  bootstapped resampling (minimum ~ 1000 samples). We can use this to find the sampling distribution of the mean, se and 95% CI "}

knitr::include_graphics("images/bootstrapping.png")
```

---

## Bootstrapping

.left-code[

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(boot)

flipper <- penguins %>% 
  filter(sex == "male") %>% 
  pull(flipper_length_mm)

mean_fun <- function(x,i){
  mean(x[i])
}

boot_1000 <- boot( #<<
  data = flipper,#<<
  statistic = mean_fun,#<<
  R = 1000#<<
)


```
]


.right-plot[

```{r}
boot_1000
```

]

---

.left-code[

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot()+
  aes(boot_1000$t)+
  geom_histogram()

```

]


.right-plot[

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot()+
  aes(boot_1000$t)+
  geom_histogram()

```

]

---

## Bootstrap Confidence Intervals

```{r}
boot.ci(boot_1000,
        conf = 0.95,
        type = "perc")

```
